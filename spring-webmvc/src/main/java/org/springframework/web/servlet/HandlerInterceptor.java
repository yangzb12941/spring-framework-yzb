/**
 * Workflow interface that allows for customized handler execution chains.
 * Applications can register any number of existing or custom interceptors
 * for certain groups of handlers, to add common preprocessing behavior
 * without needing to modify each handler implementation.
 *
 * <p>A HandlerInterceptor gets called before the appropriate HandlerAdapter
 * triggers the execution of the handler itself. This mechanism can be used
 * for a large field of preprocessing aspects, e.g. for authorization checks,
 * or common handler behavior like locale or theme changes. Its main purpose
 * is to allow for factoring out repetitive handler code.
 *
 * <p>In an asynchronous processing scenario, the handler may be executed in a
 * separate thread while the main thread exits without rendering or invoking the
 * {@code postHandle} and {@code afterCompletion} callbacks. When concurrent
 * handler execution completes, the request is dispatched back in order to
 * proceed with rendering the model and all methods of this contract are invoked
 * again. For further options and details see
 * {@code org.springframework.web.servlet.AsyncHandlerInterceptor}
 *
 * <p>Typically an interceptor chain is defined per HandlerMapping bean,
 * sharing its granularity. To be able to apply a certain interceptor chain
 * to a group of handlers, one needs to map the desired handlers via one
 * HandlerMapping bean. The interceptors themselves are defined as beans
 * in the application context, referenced by the mapping bean definition
 * via its "interceptors" property (in XML: a &lt;list&gt; of &lt;ref&gt;).
 *
 * <p>HandlerInterceptor is basically similar to a Servlet Filter, but in
 * contrast to the latter it just allows custom pre-processing with the option
 * of prohibiting the execution of the handler itself, and custom post-processing.
 * Filters are more powerful, for example they allow for exchanging the request
 * and response objects that are handed down the chain. Note that a filter
 * gets configured in web.xml, a HandlerInterceptor in the application context.
 *
 * <p>As a basic guideline, fine-grained handler-related preprocessing tasks are
 * candidates for HandlerInterceptor implementations, especially factored-out
 * common handler code and authorization checks. On the other hand, a Filter
 * is well-suited for request content and view content handling, like multipart
 * forms and GZIP compression. This typically shows when one needs to map the
 * filter to certain content types (e.g. images), or to all requests.
 *
 * Servlet API 定义的 servlet 滤器可以在 servlet 处理每个 Web 请求的前后分别对它进行前置
 * 处理和后置处理。 此外，有些时候，你可能只想处理某些 SpringMVC 处理程序处理的 Web
 * 请求，并在这些处理程序返回的模型属性被传递到视图之前，对它们进行一些操。
 * SpringMVC 允许你通过处理拦截 Web 请求，进行前置处理和后置处理。处理拦截是在
 *
 * Spring 的 Web 应用程序上下文中配置的，因此它们可以利用各种容器特性 ，并引用容器中声明
 * 的任何 bean。处理拦截是针对特殊的处理程序映射进行注册的，因此它只拦截通过这些处理程序
 * 映射的请求。每个处理拦截都必须实现 HandlerInterceptor接口，它 包含三个需要你现的回
 * 调方法： preHandle（） 、postHandle（）和 afterCompletion（） 。第一个和第二个方分别
 * 是在程序处理请求之前和之后被调用的。第二个方法还允许访问返回 ModelAndView 对象，因此可
 * 以在它里面操作模型属。 最后一个方法是在所有请求处理完成之后被调用（如视图 呈现现之后），
 * 以下是 HandlerInterceptor 的简单实现：
