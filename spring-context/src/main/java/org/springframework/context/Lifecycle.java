/**
 * A common interface defining methods for start/stop lifecycle control.
 * The typical use case for this is to control asynchronous processing.
 * <b>NOTE: This interface does not imply specific auto-startup semantics.
 * Consider implementing {@link SmartLifecycle} for that purpose.</b>
 *
 * <p>Can be implemented by both components (typically a Spring bean defined in a
 * Spring context) and containers  (typically a Spring {@link ApplicationContext}
 * itself). Containers will propagate start/stop signals to all components that
 * apply within each container, e.g. for a stop/restart scenario at runtime.
 *
 * <p>Can be used for direct invocations or for management operations via JMX.
 * In the latter case, the {@link org.springframework.jmx.export.MBeanExporter}
 * will typically be defined with an
 * {@link org.springframework.jmx.export.assembler.InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler},
 * restricting the visibility of activity-controlled components to the Lifecycle
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>Note that the present {@code Lifecycle} interface is only supported on
 * <b>top-level singleton beans</b>. On any other component, the {@code Lifecycle}
 * interface will remain undetected and hence ignored. Also, note that the extended
 * {@link SmartLifecycle} interface provides sophisticated integration with the
 * application context's startup and shutdown phases.
 *
 * 定义start/stop生命周期控制方法的通用接口。这方面的典型用例是控制异步处理。
 * 注意：此接口并不意味着特定的自动启动语义。考虑为此目的实施SmartLifecycle。
 * 可以由组件（通常是在Spring上下文中定义的Spring bean）和容器（通常是Spring ApplicationContext本身）实现。
 * 容器将向每个容器中应用的所有组件传播start/stop信号，
 * 例如，对于运行时的start/stop启动场景。 可用于直接调用或通过JMX进行管理操作。
 * 在后一种情况下，org.springframework.jmx.export.MBeanExport通常将使用
 * org.springframework.jmx.export.assembler.InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler来定义，
 * 从而限制活动控制组件在Lifecycle接口上的可见性。 请注意，当前的Lifecycle接口仅在顶级单例bean上受支持。
 * 在任何其他组件上，生命周期接口将保持未检测状态，因此被忽略。
 * 此外，请注意，扩展的SmartLifecycle界面提供了与应用程序上下文的启动和关闭阶段的复杂集成.
