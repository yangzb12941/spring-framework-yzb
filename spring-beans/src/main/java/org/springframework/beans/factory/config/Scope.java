/**
 * Strategy interface used by a {@link ConfigurableBeanFactory},
 * representing a target scope to hold bean instances in.
 * This allows for extending the BeanFactory's standard scopes
 * {@link ConfigurableBeanFactory#SCOPE_SINGLETON "singleton"} and
 * {@link ConfigurableBeanFactory#SCOPE_PROTOTYPE "prototype"}
 * with custom further scopes, registered for a
 * {@link ConfigurableBeanFactory#registerScope(String, Scope) specific key}.
 *
 * <p>{@link org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext} implementations
 * such as a {@link org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext}
 * may register additional standard scopes specific to their environment,
 * e.g. {@link org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext#SCOPE_REQUEST "request"}
 * and {@link org.springframework.web.context.WebApplicationContext#SCOPE_SESSION "session"},
 * based on this Scope SPI.
 *
 * <p>Even if its primary use is for extended scopes in a web environment,
 * this SPI is completely generic: It provides the ability to get and put
 * objects from any underlying storage mechanism, such as an HTTP session
 * or a custom conversation mechanism. The name passed into this class's
 * {@code get} and {@code remove} methods will identify the
 * target object in the current scope.
 *
 * <p>{@code Scope} implementations are expected to be thread-safe.
 * One {@code Scope} instance can be used with multiple bean factories
 * at the same time, if desired (unless it explicitly wants to be aware of
 * the containing BeanFactory), with any number of threads accessing
 * the {@code Scope} concurrently from any number of factories.

	 * in its entirety).
	 * <p><b>Note: This is an optional operation.</b> This method will only
	 * be called for scoped beans with actual destruction configuration
	 * (DisposableBean, destroy-method, DestructionAwareBeanPostProcessor).
	 * Implementations should do their best to execute a given callback
	 * at the appropriate time. If such a callback is not supported by the
	 * underlying runtime environment at all, the callback <i>must be
	 * ignored and a corresponding warning should be logged</i>.
	 * <p>Note that 'destruction' refers to automatic destruction of
	 * the object as part of the scope's own lifecycle, not to the individual
	 * scoped object having been explicitly removed by the application.
	 * If a scoped object gets removed via this facade's {@link #remove(String)}
	 * method, any registered destruction callback should be removed as well,
	 * assuming that the removed object will be reused or manually destroyed.
	 *
	 * 注册一个回调，以便在销毁作用域中的指定对象时执行（或者在销毁整个作用域时执行，如果作用域不销毁单个对象，而是仅终止其整体）。
	 * 注意：这是一个可选操作。此方法将仅针对具有实际销毁配置（DisposableBean、destroy方法、DestructionAwareBeanPostProcessor）
	 * 的作用域bean调用。实现应该尽其所能在适当的时间执行给定的回调。如果底层运行时环境根本不支持这样的回调，
	 * 则必须忽略该回调，并记录相应的警告。 请注意，“销毁”是指作为作用域自身生命周期的一部分自动销毁对象，
	 * 而不是指应用程序已明确删除的单个作用域对象。如果通过这个facade的remove（String）方法移除了一个作用域对象，
	 * 那么也应该移除任何注册的销毁回调，假设移除的对象将被重用或手动销毁。
	 *
	 * 参数：
	 * name–要执行销毁回调的对象的名称
	 * callback–要执行的销毁回调。
	 * 请注意，传入的Runnable永远不会抛出异常，因此它可以在没有封闭的try-catch块的情况下安全地执行。
	 * 此外，Runnable通常是可序列化的，前提是它的目标对象也是可序列化的。
	 *
	 * @param name the name of the object to execute the destruction callback for
	 * @param callback the destruction callback to be executed.
	 * Note that the passed-in Runnable will never throw an exception,
	 * so it can safely be executed without an enclosing try-catch block.
	 * Furthermore, the Runnable will usually be serializable, provided
	 * that its target object is serializable as well.
